    Shaking he manages to meekly raise his fists. \n\nULTIMATE PUNCH!\n\nYour fists
    collide with him square in the chest. He explodes into a burst a red mist and
    his organs begin to rain from the sky. You hear someone yell out \"HEY WHO THREW
    THIS SPLEEN AT ME!?\". You see Contestant 5 angrily waving a spleen in the air.\n\nSelect
    an action:\n1. Shrug and point at Contestant 4\n2. Stand there nonchalantly\n3.
