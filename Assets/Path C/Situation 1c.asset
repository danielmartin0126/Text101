  storyText: 'Fighting immediately erupts in the circle. You watch as others pair
    off and punch for their lives.


    You feel a tap on your shoulder. Turning
    around you see Contestant 6. You look down to him and he cautiously raises his
    fists. "I think we''re supposed to fight now" he squeaks out. He starts to wind
    up his punch and states "Ok here I go!"
