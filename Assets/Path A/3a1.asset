  storyText: "You talk over to Contestant 4's corpse and yoink the knife still stuck
    in face. Before you can even stand up you hear the buzzer sound again. \n\n\"NONPUNCHING
    ACTIVITY DETECTED. CONTESTANT 7 DISQUALIFIED\"\n\nYou look up just in time to
    see the giant claw falling down on you. It completely encloses around you and
    begins to whisk you up. Through the arms of the claw you can see the others watching.
    Then it goes dark. You can't see where you are being taken. \n\nA loud bang and
    the claw opens spilling you onto the ground. You're nearly blinded by the spotlight
    on you. To your side to see Contestant 5's body. Looking out you can barely make
    out the soldiers that make up the firing squad. \n\nYou have died. "
