  storyText: "With all your might kick the door where handle should be. With a loud
    bang the door rattles in its frame but still stands strong.\n\n\"I don't know
    if I can kick this down\" \n \nYou look back to Contestant 6. He places his hand
    on your shoulder and looks into your eyes.\n\n\"Ima yeet this bitch\"\n\nHe backs
    up a bit to get a running start. With an explosion of previously unfathomable
    fury Contestant 6 runs at the door and unleashes a might haymaker square into
    the center of it. The door crumples in half and blows open. You hear a brief
    yell as it does.\n\nSunlight pours in from outside as you both step through the
    threshold. A security guard is on the ground rubbing the back of it head.\n\n\"HEY
    YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH OUT THAT HURT A LOT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OPENING DOORS
    LIKE THAT ANYWAY IT'S DANGEROUS\"\n\nYou both ignore him and walk out onto the
    sidewalk and take in the city around you. Contestant 6 nudges you and gestures
    to the front of the building you just left. The signage reads: \n\n\"STINKY PETES
    DISCOUNT FURNATURE\"\n\nHe laughs a little bit.\n\n\"That's how I got here! I
    came because I was shopping for a new coffee table\"\n\nYou think back to how
    your morning had started with a mission to find a night stand for your bedroom.\n\nConfused
    and still without a nightstand you begin to walk home.\n\nYou have escaped the
    Punchathon."
