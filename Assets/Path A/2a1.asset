  storyText: "Contestant 5 turns to Contestant 4 and points at him with the spleen.
    \n\n\"COME HERE!\"\n\nHe sprints towards Contestant 5 and tackles him to ground.
    Withdrawing a conceal knife, he drives it into Contestant 4's face.\n\nA loud
    buzzer cuts through the air. The remaining contestants stop fighting and look
    up. The intercom crackles \n\n\"NONPUNCHING ACTIVITY DETECTED. CONTESTANT 5 DISQUALIFIED\"\n\nA
    rusted claw descends from the ceiling and drags away a screaming Contestant 5.
    You look over at Contestant 4's dead body. Knife still stuck in his face.\n\nYou
    pause to look around at those still standing. Contestants 1, 2 and 3 are looking
    around, waiting for someone to continue the fighting\n\nSelect an action:\n\n1.
    Grab the knife from Contestant 4's body\n2. Scream loudly while winding up your
