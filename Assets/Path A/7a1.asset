  storyText: 'You plop down on the ground trying to catch your breath. The intercom
    plays a small victorious tune.


    "PUNCHATHON HAS CONCLUDED. CONTESTANT 7
    IS VICTORIOUS"


    A concealed door in the side of the arena opens letting
    sunlight in. A security guard walks in. In an impatient tone he yells to you
    while gesturing outside.


    "HEY BUDDY. Beat it! Time to go"


    You gather
    yourself up and manage to hobble towards the door. As you pass the security guard
    he stops you and hands you a small brass medal. You continue out into the sun.
    It takes a moment for your vision to adjust but once it does you see the sidewalk
    and other pedestrians walking by. No one pays you much mind despite your condition.


    You
    look back at the building and read the sign across the front.


    "STINKY PETE''S
    DISCOUNT FURNATURE"


    You walk away a victorious Punchathon champion.


    You
    have won.'
