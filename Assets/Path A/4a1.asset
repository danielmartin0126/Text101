  storyText: 'You run full speed at Contestant 3, screaming and flailing your arms
    around. The two of you collide violently and fall to the ground. In the ensuing
    scuffle you punch as you have never punched before.


    In the end you prevail.
    Standing exhausted you look over to see Contestant 2 in a similar state leaving
    behind a defeated Contestant 1. Only the two of you remain.


    Select an action:


    1.
    Take a nap

    2. Run at Contestant 2'
