  storyText: "\"Let's knock this down together\"\n\nYou both line up side by side
    and countdown.\n\n\"3...2...1\"\n\nThe two of you crash into the door at the
    exact same moment. A loud clang as the door is knocked out of it's frame. You
    fall with the door outside into the sunlight.\n\nYou hear a bit of yelling as
    a security guard struggles to wiggle his way out from underneath the destroyed
    door.\n\n\"HEY YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH OUT THAT HURT A LOT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
    OPENING DOORS LIKE THAT ANYWAY IT'S DANGEROUS\"\n\nYou both ignore him and walk
    out onto the sidewalk and take in the city around you. Contestant 6 nudges you
    and gestures to the front of the building you just left. The signage reads: \n\n\"STINKY
    PETES DISCOUNT FURNATURE\"\n\nHe laughs a little bit.\n\n\"That's how I got here!
    I came because I was shopping for a new coffee table\"\n\nYou think back to how
    your morning had started with a mission to find a night stand for your bedroom.\n\nConfused
    and still without a nightstand you begin to walk home.\n\nYou have escaped the
    Punchathon."
